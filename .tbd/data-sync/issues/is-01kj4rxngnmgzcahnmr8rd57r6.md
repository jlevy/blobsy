Consolidate all documentation updates across phases: README (Quick Start uses blobsy add, Commands table updated, Ignore Patterns section, Git Hooks section, config flags). SKILL.md (all new commands and flags). CHANGELOG.md (all Added/Changed/Fixed entries). Design doc (add command, hooks, config flags, docs commands). This bead ensures nothing is missed if docs are deferred during phase implementation.
