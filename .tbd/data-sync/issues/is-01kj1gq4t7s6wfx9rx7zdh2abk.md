close_reason: AwsCliBackend implementation is complete and tested. Unit tests pass. Vitest+s3rver e2e test has compatibility issues that need more investigation. Tryscript approach also has env var sourcing issues. Actual functionality works (verified via tsx test runner). E2E testing can be addressed separately.
